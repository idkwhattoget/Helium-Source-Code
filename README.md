# helium source code
its the helium source code yea

## wheres the code for the rewrite?
i forgot that was even a thing

# warnings

- do not skid this for your shitvival (unless you are reviving helium and you credit me)
- you have to edit some parts of the source code to your stuff (like the db name, db password, recaptcha sitekey and recaptcha privatekey) to make it fully functional
- client apis **are not included and you have to get them yourself**
- the source code logs ips and you might wanna remove that for security
- this probably has a lot of vulnerabilities so fix those before using this
- this uses php so prepare for testicle cancer
- dont use the old db its really old (lol) and it prob wont work with the source code provided
- the website source code uses the new version where i tried to revive helium but failed
- client warnings (there is a lot so i put them here)
    - the client isnt tested and probably doesnt work
    - source codes for the launcher and updater are not provided, edit them with programs like dnspy or dotpeek (programs like hxd and x32dbg **wont work because the launcher and updater is made in c#**)
    - the client is patched to helium.xyz so change that
    - the host file (real.bat) goes to some random ct8 site i made so change that
    - the launcher and updater goes to helium.xyz for api shit so also change that with programs like dnspy or dotpeek (programs like hxd and x32dbg **wont work because the launcher and updater is made in c#**)
    - the updater isnt included so make your own

***theres probably a lot of things i missed so use this with caution***
